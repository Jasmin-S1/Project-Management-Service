This project is some kind of a system or service to manage projects an developers. This project is not finished yet, but here for begin, I created here some endpoints, class models, database and connection to the database. I used SQLite for creating database, and Python(with it's modern framework FastApi) for creating this API.
Among other files, here are two files named main.py and new.py. In main.py I created some endpoints and connection to the database (where I wrote some SQLite query), and in new.py file I tried to do same thing but without database, just use dictionary for storing data from HTTP requests.
